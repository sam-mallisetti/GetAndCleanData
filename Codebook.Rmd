## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Codebook for Tidy Data generated from run_analysis.R code

Tidy Data (tidydata.txt) contains summarized data from a study conducted on 30 participants for 6 activities using a Samsung wearable device. There were 10,299 observations summarized into 180 by averaging on each of the 79 selected measurements for each subject and activity combination. In the original data there were 561 measurements, but as per the project instructions we selected only those which contained "mean" or "std" in their names. Below is a description of all the variables and activities. 

Subjects are numbered 1 to 30.
Activities are Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking downstairs, and Walking upstairs.

79 Variables are provided below:
1.  "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"          Mean of Body Acceleration Angle X component in Radians
